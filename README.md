# About me

👋 Hi, I’m @nicolas0dupuy
I'm currently a ***math instructor*** in France 🇫🇷. <br>
I have a passionate interest in tech domains such as ***Scientific Programing***, ***Machine Learning***, ***Computer Vision***, ***Quantum Computing***

# My academic background

I have a **Ph. D. in Physics**. I have spent a very long time learning in my university and I loved it. <br>
I have a very fragmented academic education, some years I quit for private-teaching full time, and then resume again until I succeed. <br>
My **biggest difficulty : to choose what I want to do** 

## Here is a **chronological summary** : 
***2000-2002 : DEUG Science de la Matière (1st and 2nd years in Physics)*** <br>
During those 2 years, I aquired solid pre-graduate fundamentals in **Newton Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics**<br>
I also had minors in **Chemistry, Mathematics** <br>
📚 I learned a lot from books. I prepared for the entrance exam to the **École Normale Supérieure** which normaly requires a special preparation in elite schools I wasn't accepted in,
so I decided to train by myself (Spoiler alert : I failed... 😁). <br>
**Books I learned during those 2 years** : <br>
***Berkeley Physics Course*** including Purcell's very good electromagnetism introduction. <br>
Analysis and Algebra books from ***Jean-Marie Monier*** aimed from classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles <br>
**Analyse** from Laurent Schwartz (stopped in the middle of 3rd part), classic reference book covering topology, differential calculus and geometry, and measure theory <br>
*and of course a lot of exercices books*

***2003-2006 : Licence, Maîtrise de Mathématiques Fondamentales (3rd and 4th university years in Mathematics)*** <br>
I shifted to mathematics for my self-preparation goals to the ENS entrance exams. I had more chances this way. I discovered that I love mathematics as much as Physics. I was in trouble with such a love triangle. <br>
I also started to learn Russian :ru: and got so passionate that I failed my 1st exams for my maîtrise and had to retry. <br>
My failure to the ENS exams discouraged me and after 3years of intensive maths training, I needed to learn something else and started Russian. <br>
