# About me

👋 Hi, I’m @nicolas0dupuy
I'm currently a ***math instructor*** in France 🇫🇷. <br>
I have a passionate interest in tech domains such as ***Scientific Programing***, ***Machine Learning***, ***Computer Vision***, ***Quantum Computing***

# My academic background

I have a **Ph. D. in Physics**. I have spent a very long time learning in my university and I loved it. <br>
I have a very fragmented academic education, some years I quit for private-teaching full time, and then resume again until I succeed. <br>
My **biggest difficulty : to choose what I want to do** 

## Here is a **chronological summary** : 
***2000-2002 : DEUG Science de la Matière (1st and 2nd years in Physics)*** <br>
During those 2 years, I aquired solid pre-graduate fundamentals in **Newton Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics**<br>
I also had minors in **Chemistry, Mathematics** <br>
📚 I learned a lot from books. I prepared for the entrance exam to the **École Normale Supérieure** which normaly requires a special preparation in elite schools I wasn't accepted in,
so I decided to train by myself (Spoiler alert : I failed... 😁). <br>
**Books I learned during those 2 years** : <br>
***Berkeley Physics Course*** including Purcell's very good electromagnetism introduction. <br>
Analysis and Algebra books from ***Jean-Marie Monier*** aimed from classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles <br>
**Analyse** from Laurent Schwartz (stopped in the middle of 3rd part), classic reference book covering topology, differential calculus and geometry, and measure theory <br>
*and of course a lot of exercices books*

***2002-2005 : Licence, Maîtrise de Mathématiques Fondamentales (3rd and 4th university years in Mathematics)*** <br>
I shifted to mathematics for my self-preparation to the ENS exams. I had more chances this way. I discovered that I love mathematics as much as Physics. This was the start of a love triangle with difficult choices to make. <br>
I also started to learn Russian and got so passionate that I failed my 1st exams for my maîtrise and had to retry it. <br>
My failure to the ENS exams discouraged me and after 3years of intensive maths training, I needed to learn something else and started Russian. <br>
I learned Russian in the Inalco (institute of eastern languages) with around 14 hours a week repartited in grammar, written and oral expression, pronounciation lab. <br>
**Books I learned during those 3 years** : <br>
I didn't give up Physics and audit to various courses. I deepened topics such as ***quantum mechanics*** by studying classics like
***Bohm***'s , ***Cohen Tannoudji***. I also discovered lately ***Feynman's Physics course*** which I started reading again at the time I'm writing. I wanted to understand ***General Relativity*** and learned ***Missner Thorne and Wheeler*** for that. <br>
I loved differential geometry so I learned from authors like ***Petersen*** and because I also loved abstract algebra, I learned ***Algebra*** from Serges Lang. <br>
I also started to learned by practicing small homemade numerical simulations in C mainly (or in Caml, Maple, Mathematica)

***2005-2010 : Master degree Sciences des Matériaux et Nano-objets*** <br>
Those years were a period of doubts, where I mostly worked as a private maths teacher. I have cumulated hundreds of students of every level from middle school to university.
Meanwhile I first attempted to pass a Master degree in Fundamental Mathematics and failed 2 attempts because of my irregularity. It still gave me thinking methods that helps me today. <br>
I made up my mind when I decided to go for a Ph D in Physics and passed a Master in Material Science.
