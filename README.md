# About me

👋 Hi, I’m @nicolas0dupuy
I'm currently a ***math instructor*** in France 🇫🇷. <br>
I have a passionate interest in tech domains such as ***Scientific Programing***, ***Machine Learning***, ***Computer Vision***, ***Quantum Computing***

# My academic background

I have a **Ph. D. in Physics**. I have spent a very long time learning in my university and I loved it. <br>
I have a very fragmented academic education, some years I quit for private-teaching full time, and then resume again until I succeed. <br>
My **biggest difficulty : to choose what I want to do** 

## Here is a **chronological summary** : 
***2000-2002 : DEUG Science de la Matière (1st and 2nd years in Physics)*** <br>
During those 2 years, I aquired solid pre-graduate fundamentals in **Newton Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics**<br>
I also had minors in **Chemistry, Mathematics** <br>
📚 I learned a lot from books. I prepared for the entrance exam to the **École Normale Supérieure** which normaly requires a special preparation in elite schools I wasn't accepted in,
so I decided to train by myself (Spoiler alert : I failed... 😁).
**Books I learned during those 2 years** :
