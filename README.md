# About me

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @nicolas0dupuy
I'm currently a ***math instructor*** in France üá´üá∑. <br>
I have a passionate interest in tech domains such as ***Scientific Programing***, ***Machine Learning***, ***Computer Vision***, ***Quantum Computing***

# My academic background

I have a **Ph. D. in Physics**. I have spent a very long time learning in my university and I loved it. <br>
I have a very fragmented academic education, some years I quit for private-teaching full time, and then resume again until I succeed. <br>
My **biggest difficulty : to choose what I want to do** 

## Here is a **chronological summary** : 
***2000-2002 : DEUG Science de la Mati√®re (1st and 2nd years in Physics)*** <br>
During those 2 years, I aquired solid pre-graduate fundamentals in **Newton Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics**<br>
I also had minors in **Chemistry, Mathematics** <br>
üìö I learned a lot from books. I prepared for the entrance exam to the **√âcole Normale Sup√©rieure** which normaly requires a special preparation in elite schools I wasn't accepted in,
so I decided to train by myself (Spoiler alert : I failed... üòÅ). <br>
**Books I learned during those 2 years** : <br>
***Berkeley Physics Course*** including Purcell's very good electromagnetism introduction. <br>
Analysis and Algebra books from ***Jean-Marie Monier*** aimed from classes pr√©paratoires aux grandes √©coles <br>
**Analyse** from Laurent Schwartz (stopped in the middle of 3rd part), classic reference book covering topology, differential calculus and geometry, and measure theory <br>
*and of course a lot of exercices books*

***2002-2005 : Licence, Ma√Ætrise de Math√©matiques Fondamentales (3rd and 4th university years in Mathematics)*** <br>
I shifted to mathematics for my self-preparation to the ENS exams. I had more chances this way. I discovered that I love mathematics as much as Physics. This was the start of a love triangle with difficult choices to make. <br>
During those years, I had a pretty good start and was one of the top students in 3rd year ***Algebra*** (group theory mainly, and less affine and projective geometry)
and ***topology*** (abstract topological spaces). I had my downs then in the second semester and was just ok with ***Measure theory and holomorphic functions***, or ***Differential calculus*** and ***ordinary differential equations***.
In 4th year, I deepened ***Algebra*** (Rings, Polynomial extensions and Galois theory), ***Differential geometry***, ***Functional analysis and Spectral theory***. <br>
I also started to learn Russian and got so passionate that I failed my 1st exams for my ma√Ætrise and had to retry it. <br>
My failure to the ENS exams discouraged me and after 3 years of intensive maths training, I needed to learn something else and started Russian. <br>
I learned Russian in the Inalco (institute of eastern languages) with around 14 hours a week repartited in grammar, written and oral expression, pronounciation lab. <br>
**Books I learned during those 3 years** : <br>
I didn't give up Physics and audit to various courses. I deepened topics such as ***quantum mechanics*** by studying classics like
***Bohm***'s , ***Cohen Tannoudji***. I also discovered lately ***Feynman's Physics course*** which I started reading again at the time I'm writing. I wanted to understand ***General Relativity*** and learned ***Missner Thorne and Wheeler*** for that. <br>
I loved differential geometry so I learned from authors like ***Petersen*** and because I also loved abstract algebra, I learned ***Algebra*** from Serges Lang. <br>
I also started to learned by practicing small homemade numerical simulations in C mainly (or in Caml, Maple, Mathematica)

***2005-2010 + 2010-2012 : Master degree Sciences des Mat√©riaux et Nano-objets*** <br>
Those years were a period of doubts, where I mostly worked as a private maths teacher. I have cumulated hundreeds of students of different levels from middle school to university.
Meanwhile I first attempted to pass a Master degree in Fundamental Mathematics and failed 2 attempts because of my irregularity. It still gave me thinking methods that helps me today. <br>
I made up my mind when I decided to go for a Ph. D. in Physics and passed a Master in Material Science. <br>
Topics included ***Magnetism***, ***Surface electronics***, ***solid state physics***, ***chemistry***, and ***numerical simulations***.
It was challenging for me because I hadn't learned material science before and I passed this degree in two years. Meanwhile I slowly decrease the number of students I was teaching to prepare toward a Ph. D. <br>

***2012-2016 : Doctorate in Material Science - Numerical computation of the electronic states of the acene family by Quantum Monte Carlo methods*** <br>
I looked for a subject having components in Mathematics, Physics and involve numerical computation. I had been offered this opportunity and it was the beginning of 3 and a half challenfing years. <br>
Doing research requires a lot of patience to handle new tools, understand new theory, prepare simulations, monitor them, correct them when they are misconfigured (which happens a lot when you are clumsy as I am!), and when it gives results (fortunately it does!) process, gather, and understand them. <br>
I was lucky because I had a very patient advisor. It is difficult to supervise a student which is not standard, because traditional recipes doesn't match the situation. I got my first (and only at this stage) research papers. English writing was challenging. Although I love foreign languages, writting a scientific paper is already difficult in my own language, but adding the necessity to write in a clean and professional English, and of course keeping working on my theories, made the task very requiring to me. I also learned a lot both mathematicaly and in Physics, since not only the theory involved many thematics from material science (such as electronic and spin correlations, symmetry properties), the employed methods required also a strong mathematical understanding of specific Monte Carlo methods implying also an understanding of the partial differential equation they solve and the numerical approximation they use. 

# Languages

My native language is French. I was rather a *scientific* person than *literary*, but thanks to my parents I had reading habbits in my childhood which prevented me from closing myself excessively to mathematics. It almost happened when I was in 3rd university year, and I suddently felt the need to open my mind to philosophy and languages. It started with th Russian languages. I wanted to learn it since my teenagehood when I was a compulsive chess player (I apologise for the clich√©). After that, I started to love hearing new sounds, new way to formulate ideas, and started to study a little too much of too many different languages...

## English

English was my secondary foreign language in high school. I have started to improve it only when I needed to read academic books in mathematics and physics. Only later, I also started to be more interested in literature and to make the effort to read English text (maybe around when I was 25 years old, and began to do my first trips abroad, and met English people in youth hostel making me interested). Now, I am trying to maintain it. I maybe lack regular practice, and although I have been at a C1 level of understanding last summer, I am currently thinking about a way to improve my own speaking. Indeed, even in Franch I sometime struggle finding my words, so I need to double the efforts in a foreign language. Meanwhile, fortunately, learning is always fun to me.

## Russian

Russian is a language I started to learn after my 3rd university year. I tried to learn it in parallel with my 4th year of matematics, but got too passionated that I failed my exams. I studied russian in the INALCO, which is the French institute for eastern language, but also teaches many languages from around the globe, which are less taughed in other university (including slavic, nordic, african languages). I even stopped reading maths books only during my commute time to learn russian poetry by heart.

## German

German was my 1st foreign language in high school. I started to learn it already in elementary school thanks to a very devoted teacher who took many positive initiatives. Although I love German, I had stopped practicing it for too long, and I am only learning it again since few months (at the day I am writing).
